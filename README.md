Howdy!  I'm a student at the University of Manitoba studying computer science.  When I'm not doing schoolwork, I like telling stories and sharing ideas
through whatever mediums I can get my hands on: writing, drawing, TTRPGs, and of course coding!
I love to code since it allows interaction and functionality that other things don't.
